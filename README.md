# Spotipy
This project allows the user to easily create spotify playlists using python! Simply add the songs you want to the list "list_of_songs" and they will be added to your new playlist!
In the future I will be adding functionality to create playlists from a string to hopefully make a playlist of the entire bee movie script, however it is proving difficult because spotify restricts the number of requests to not get api spammed.

Here are some cool playlists I made with this script!
